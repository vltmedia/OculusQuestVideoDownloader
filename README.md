- Windows 32bit

- Oculus Developer ID

- Oculus Quest in Developer Mode

- adb Installed (automatically installed if using NVIDIA Gameworks to install Android dev stuff on your computer)

  - Check adb by typing in Command Prompt. If stuff comes up that isn't an error, you're good.

    ```

    

## Instructions

1. Paste in the target folder path of where you want the files to be downloaded to.

2. If you want to pull all the files recorded by the Quest, Check the "Pull All Files" box. If you only want to pull a single file, you will have to find the filename of the exact file. this can be done by going to "This PC\Quest\Internal shared storage\Oculus\VideoShots". This can only be done after Developer mode has been turned on on your Quest.
